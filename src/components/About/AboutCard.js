            Hey there! I'm <span className="purple">NIKHIL Kumar</span>, hailing from the vibrant city of <span className="purple"> Chandigarh, India</span>.
            <br />
            ðŸŽ“ With a B.Tech in Computer Science and a B.S. in Programming and Data Science from IIT Madras 
            <br />
            under my belt, I'm all about blending tech with creativity. Coding is my playground, but there's more to my story.
            <br />
            <br />
            ðŸŽ¸ When I'm not cracking code, you'll find me making musicâ€”whether itâ€™s strumming my guitar or crafting new tunes. 
            <br />
            <br />
            ðŸ’ª The gym is my second home, where I push limits and stay sharp.
            <br />
            And when it's time to unwind, I dive into thought-provoking books on business, management, and the art of building companies ðŸ“š.
            <br />
            <br />
            In short, I'm all about leveling up, whether it's in tech, tunes, or transforming ideas into reality ðŸš€.
            <br />
